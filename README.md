# AISD: Sorting algoritms, Graph algoritms, Trees and more.

A set of programs created by me on my  'Algorithms and Data Structures' labs. Contains many main algorithmic problems (see Readme). Thomas Cormen help was invaluable :)

- List
- Cycle List
- Fifo / Lifo
- Priority Queue

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort
- Dual Pivot Quick Sort

- Selection Alghoritm
- Random Select Alghoritm


- Binary Search
- Binary Search Tree
- Red Black Tree
- Hash Map (with dynamic chain)

- Dijkstra Algotithm for finding shortest path in graph which uses priority queue
- Kruskal and Prim algorithm for finding best mst
- TSP, based on searching for the closest node and optimal path with polynomial time

... and more.
Commpares and swaps are beeing counting as well as time of alghoritm, complexity and memory needed. Some charts printed in python.
